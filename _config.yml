   Hi, my name's Vishal and I'm senior at BML Munjal University. I have experience in Machine Learning, Problem Solving, Algorithms, Data Analytics, etc. I have worked at a number of companies gaining teamwork and leadership skills.
  
   I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. The things that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Python</mark> , <mark>C++</mark> , <mark>Java</mark> , <mark>git</mark> , <mark>Docker</mark>.
   
   I am looking for opportunities that allow me to apply Computational Thinking and Algorithmic problem solving skills to help solve problems that make impact on a big scale and further enhance my knowledge.
