    Assistant for Researchers
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I did this project as a part of Information Retrieval Course. 
    This tool helps researchers to find research papers on topic which they are working on.
    The researcher provides a link to a sample research paper (pdf) and then this tool parse the text from pdf to create a query which is used to crawl the internet.
    This tool uses focused crawling which helped reduce search time and improved efficiency.
    As this tool crawls the internet to search for research papers so it can only find openly accessible research papers.
    Implemented using Python and its libraries like *BeautifulSoup*, *NLTK*, *request*, *PyPDF*.

    Worked on backend of these tools
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    As a part of Crio Launch program I worked on backend of these applications. 
    QBox: QBox is a secure file-sharing service. It is a customized version of the popularly available VSFTPD server.
    QMoney: QMoney is a visual stock portfolio analyzer. It helps portfolio managers make trade recommendations for their clients.
    QCharm: QCharm is an online IDE. Programmers use QCharm to write source code and execute it inside the editor.
    While working on these projects I acquired various skills like Shell Scriptins, REST API, Code Refactoring, Applied DS, etc. 
    More details of the project can be found in the portfolio issued by Crio.do (link can be found above).
