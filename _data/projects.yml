    Assistant for Researchers
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - This tool helps researchers to find research papers on topic which they are working on.
    - The researcher provides a link to a sample research paper (pdf) and then this tool parse the text from pdf to create a query which is used to crawl the internet.
    - This tool uses focused crawling which helped reduce search time and improved efficiency.
    - As this tool crawls the internet to search for research papers so it can only find openly accessible research papers.
    - Implemented using Python and its libraries like <mark>BeautifulSoup</mark> , <mark>NLTK</mark> , <mark>request</mark> , <mark>PyPDF</mark>.

    Worked on backend of these tools
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - As a part of Crio Launch program I worked on backend of these applications. 
      - QBox: QBox is a secure file-sharing service. It is a customized version of the popularly available VSFTPD server.
      - QMoney: QMoney is a visual stock portfolio analyzer. It helps portfolio managers make trade recommendations for their clients.
      - QCharm: QCharm is an online IDE. Programmers use QCharm to write source code and execute it inside the editor.
    - While working on these projects I acquired various skills like Shell Scriptins, REST API, Code Refactoring, Applied DS, etc. 
    - More details of the project can be found in the [portfolio](https://criodo.github.io/Crio-Launch-Feb-2020-makeavish786) issued by Crio.do.
