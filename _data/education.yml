    During my time at BMU I learnt most of my key skills such as team work, project management and clearing strict deadlines. Although we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to my advantage in my day to day work. 
    I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
    I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *ACM Student Chapter* taking on roles such as *Executive Member* and *Event Organiser*.
